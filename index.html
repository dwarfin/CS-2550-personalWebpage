    <h2>Brief Essay</h2>

    <p>One thing that interests me is computers. A little while back I took a coding boot camp and that is what really got me interested in computers and computer programming. Since then I have continued learing other languages and have really enjoyed it.</p>
    <p>A little bit ago I got a 3d printer. I have printed many various different things from benchys to desk items. In high school I took an intro to engineering class that taught Fusion 360. Fusion 360 is a computer-aided design (CAD) software that allows you to create 3d items. These items can then be exported and 3d printed. I have also tried to learn blender which is a 3d creation suite which can also be 3d printed. It has been fun learning these different softwares and being able to create a tangible object from something that was once just on a computer screen.</p>
    <p>I enjoy biking, road and mountain, hiking, and just being outside. Especially here in Utah where there are many good hiking and biking trails. One last thing that I enjoy is cooking. One of my favorites is homemade pasta with chicken.</p>
